Write your domain model in the domain.md file (or add a screenshot if using another tool)
Share your domain models in ⁠⁠collaboration
NOTE: Create a Domain Model assuming you are using just JS functions to implement the solution (i.e. not classes). Then 
repeat the process using JS Classes (properties and methods).

REMEMBER: there is no best design here; the important thing is ensuring that the function / classes you design meet the 
requirement of the user stories
